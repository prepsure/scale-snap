  Scale Snap is a small plugin that allows the use of keys to scale parts precisely instead of dragging the mouse in Roblox Studio
</p>

## Setup
1. Download the plugin, either through [Roblox's library](https://www.roblox.com/library/7034469724/Scale-Snap) or by installing the [latest release](https://github.com/presssssure/scale-snap/releases) in your local plugins folder.
2. Open the Customize Shortcuts Window in Roblox Studio

3. Search "snap" and bind these to whatever keys you'd like to use!

## Usage
Click on a part's face in studio and toggle Scale Snap, then extend or retract part faces with the keys on your keyboard

## Tips!
- Change Scale Snap's increment by changing your studio move increment in the Model tab
- You can quickly check if the plugin is toggled by looking in the bottom right corner of the viewport
