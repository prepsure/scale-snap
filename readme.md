## Tips!
- Ctrl-click faces to select multiple at once!
- Change Scale Snap's increment by changing your studio move increment in the Model tab
- You can quickly check if the plugin is toggled by looking in the bottom right corner of the viewport
  - If the icon is orange, you have precision mode enabled, otherwise it'll be purple!
